### About me:

_Hello there! My name is Alex. I'm a senior **copywriter, content creator, and graphic designer** with **5+ years of experience** producing high-converting and lead-generating content across multiple channels and developing strategies that are consistent with the brand voice and identity._

_I was always passionate about words because, let's face it, what we say and how we say it is VERY important. However, while I love writing about everything, these are some of my copywriting strengths:_

- Website copy
- Landing pages
- Email campaigns
- Blog posts and articles
- Social media copy
- Press releases
- Scriptwriting

_Recently, I decided that I would like to not only write content and create web designs, but also create web applications and websites on my own._

I'm hoping that as a linguist by training, I'll be able to master all of the programming skills and become a cool front-end developer.

### My coding skills:

- Basic HTML & CSS
- Basic Javascript
- Git

### My code examples:

```
const superShuffle = function (arr) {
return arr
.map((item) => [Math.random(), item])
.sort()
.map((item) => item[1]);
};
```

### My education:

1. Minsk State Linguistic University (2015-2019)
2. Minsk Linguistic College (2011-2015)

### English level:

**Advanced (C1)**
